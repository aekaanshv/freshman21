<p>A tribute to Twenty Twelve and Twenty eleven.</p>

<p>I like wordpressâ€™s theme Twenty Twelve and Twenty eleven very much. 
So I called my Jekyll theme Freshman21 (Freshman <q>twenty-first</q> , it means twenty-first century, not twenty-one), this theme is based on my former theme <a href="https://github.com/yulijia/freshman/">Freshman</a>.</p>

<p>Freshman21 have two main page format, one is <a href="http://yulijia.net/en/" title="see demo">single column</a>, the other is two columns. For more details, please see the articles on the site.</p>

<p><cite>Proudly enjoy using Freshman21 theme.</cite> <code>;)</code></p>
