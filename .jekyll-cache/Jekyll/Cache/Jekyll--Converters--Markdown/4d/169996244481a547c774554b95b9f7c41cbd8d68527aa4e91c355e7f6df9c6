I"Q<p>I made a small change in the gh-pages branch, add google analytics script.</p>

<p>The main <q>JS</q> script was in the <q>_include</q> folder, and  this JS file was included in <q>head.html</q>.</p>

<p>In <q>_config.yml</q> file, I add the Google analytics key.</p>

<p>To fork the version with google analytics, please try this command:</p>

<p><code>git clone --branch gh-pages https://github.com/yulijia/freshman21.git</code></p>
